%% Please read README.md on https://github.com/tramarobin/fctSnPM for all information

% Using spm1d package (v.0.4.3), compute anova and post-hoc tests from anova1 to anova3rm, with a non-parametric approach (permutation tests)
% The type of anova (if required) and post-hoc are choosen regarding the independant or repeated measure effect given in parameters.
% The function automatically adapts to 1D and 2D data
% You can find different scripts creating output for 1D and 2D data in ...\fctSnPM\Examples
% 1D examples are torque ratios
% 2D examples are maps obtained with continuous wavelet transforms

% Please visit http://spm1d.org/index.html for information
% spm1d package for matlab is published elswhere : https://github.com/0todd0000/spm1dmatlab

% WARNINGS:

% Unbalanced two- and three-way repeated-measures ANOVA results have not been verified.
% Example: more subjects in Group 1 than in Group 2.
% Please interpret results for these designs with caution, and recognize that they might not be valid.

% Post-hoc tests with Bonferonni correction are only approximate

% Effect sizes and confidence intervals are not validated

% OUTPUTS
%`snpmAnalysis.mat` is a structure composed of the results of teh statistical analysis (ANOVA + Post Hoc).

%`snpmAnalysis.anova` is composed of different fields :
%* `type` is the type of ANOVA performed
%* `effectNames` is a structure (one cell for each effect) that represent the names of the effects tested (mains and interactions)
%* `alpha` is the alpha risk choosen for the anova (default is 0.05 (5%)).
%* `pCritical` is the alpha risk used for the anova. Warning message is displayed if this value is modified.
%* `nPermutations` is the number of permutations performed for the anova.
%* `maxPermutations` is the number of maximal permutations possible for the anova.
%* `Fcontinuum` is a structure that represent the F-value for each node
%* `Fthreshold` is a structure that represent the statistical threshold for the F-values (statistical inference)
%* `Fsignificant` is a structure that contains the logical for the significance (Fcontinuum > Fthreshold) of each effect of the ANOVA (1 if significant, 0 if not).
%* `clusterLocation` is a structure (one for each significant cluster) that contains the location (start and end as indexes) of each significant cluster.
%* `clusterP` is a structure (one for each significant cluster) that contains the p-value of each significant cluster.

%`clusterLocation` and `clusterP` are created only in one dimension

%`snpmAnalysis.posthoc` is a strucure of cells (one for each effect of the ANOVA) composed of different fields :
%* `data.names` is a structure that contains the name of the conditions used in the analysis (\cap is the union of different conditions for interactions).
%* `data.continuum` is a structure that contains the data used in the analysis.

%For the following outputs, the number of cells of the structure correspond to the number of t-tests performed, one t-test corresponds to one cell.
%* `differences.names` is the name of the conditions (the first minus the second) used in the differences and t-tests.
%* `differences.continuum` is the data used to plot differences.
%* `differences.continuumRelative` is the data used to plot relative differences
%* `differences.ES` is the effect size that correspond to the differences (Hedge's g)
%* `differences.ESsd` is the standard deviation of the effect size.
%* `tTests.type` is the type of t-test performed (independant or paired)
%* `tTests.names` is the name of the conditions (the first minus the second) used in the differences and t-tests.
%* `tTests.nWarning` represents the number of warnings displayed during the analysis : 0 is OK, 1 means the number of permutations was reduced but `pCritical` = `pBonferroni`, 2 means that the number of permutations was reduced and `pCritical` > `pBonferroni`. In this case, more subjects are required to performed the analysis. %* `tTests.alphaOriginal` is the alpha risk choosen for the post hoc tests  before Bonferroni correction (default is the same as the ANOVA).
%* `tTests.alpha` is the alpha risk choosen for the post hoc tests  before Bonferroni correction (default is the same as the ANOVA).
%* `tTests.warning` : only if alpha is modified with `alphaT` input.
%* `tTests.pBonferroni` is the alpha risk choosen for the post hoc tests after Bonferroni correction.
%* `tTests.pCritical` is the alpha risk used for the post hoc tests. Warning message is displayed if this value does not meet pBonferroni.
%* `tTests.maxPermutations` is the number of maximal permutations possible for the t-test.
%* `tTests.Tcontinuum` represents the T-value for each node
%* `tTests.Tthreshold` represents the statistical threshold for the T-values (statistical inference)
%* `tTests.Tsignificant` contains the logical for the significance (Tcontinuum > Tthreshold) (1 if significant, 0 if not). This value is corrected with the result of the corresponding ANOVA and previous t-tests.

%* `tTests.clusterLocation` is a structure (one for each significant cluster) that contains the location (start and end as indexes) of each significant cluster.
%* `tTests.clusterP` is a structure (one for each significant cluster) that contains the p-value of each significant cluster. This value is corrected with inverse Bonferonni correction.
%`clusterLocation` and `clusterP` are created only in one dimension and are not corrected with the result of the ANOVA.

%* `tTests.contourSignificant` represents a modified T-value continuum to display smoother contour plots.
%`tTests.contourSignificant is created only in two dimensions.

%% INPUTS
% OBLIGATORY
% Data are presented in cells and correspond to the mean of the subject if there are multiple trials (to consider a trial effect, specify a repeated measure parameter)
% rows = subjects // columns=conditions (repeared measure effects)
% For 1D data, data MUST be of size (X,1), X being the number of nodes
% Independant effects : 1 cell by effect. Must correspond to the number of subjects
% Repeated measures effects : 1 cell by effect. Must correspond to the number of columns in the dataset.
% avoid the same typo (e.g., POST, POST2) for the effect names, it affects
% the recognition for the multiples comparisons
% also avoid underscore (_) or minus (-) sign. Spaces are OK

% OPTIONAL
% see the description at begining of the function (inputParser) or on GitHub (https://github.com/tramarobin/fctSnPM#optional-inputs)
% see ./fctSnPM/Examples for help

%% Information
% All the dataset must be balanced for ANOVA 2 and 3
% Post-hoc tests with Bonferonni correction are only approximate
% See spm1d.org for the spm1d package information used with this functions.
% works with spm1d v.0.4.3 and non-parametric (permutation test) approach
